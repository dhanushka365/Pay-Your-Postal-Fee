# Pay-Your-Postal-Fee
Every amount of postage fee of 12 rupees or more can be formed using just 4-rupee and 5-rupee stamps. Write a recursive function to find out a way of representing a value higher than or equal to 12, only using 5-rupee and 4-rupee stamps. There can be multiple ways of doing it, but you have to find only one way.
